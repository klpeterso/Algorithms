# Algorithms
----
Hello, there!

If you've reached this, you've stumbled upon my little "coding playground." This repo is the culmination of things that I wanted to post on GitHub, however I intend to tailor this more towards exploring, analyzing, and implementing various algorithms. 

The goal of this is not to show off or anything like that. I'm mainly looking to get my hands a little dirty, crank out some code, and simply have fun in doing so.

If upon review of my code, you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
